Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App


Dog-project is an app based on convolutional neural network structure. It takes an image as an input and classifies it as a human, 
a dog, or neither. 
Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human face, 
the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
